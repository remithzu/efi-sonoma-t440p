## üß∞ Setup Tools Required
Setting Up OpenCore EFI on Lenovo ThinkPad T440p
* [Python](): to run some script.
* [OpenCore](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg): Base EFI.
* [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree): For editing plist files.
* [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS): To generate SMBIOS information.
* [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher): To flash a USB drive.
* Disks/gParted: For formatting and mounting the EFI partition (Linux).
* Partition Wizard: For formatting and mounting the EFI partition (Windows).

## üóúÔ∏è Preparation
1. Install Python to your computer.
2. Downloading image:

    <b>Using recovery image:</b>

    Enter OpenCore directory and Enter Utilities and macrecovery
    ```bash
    cd OpenCorePkg/Utilities/macrecovery/
    ```
    Open recovery_urls.txt to select recovery image you need, and run the script to download.

    ```bash
    ./macrecovery.py -b Mac-C3EC7CD22292981F -m 00000000000F0HM00 download
    ```

    <b>Using vanila image:</b>

## üéõÔ∏è Setup Instructions
<b>Step 1: Clone the EFI Repository</b>
1. Clone the Repository:

    Open a terminal (Linux/macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows).
Run the following command to clone the EFI files:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/remithzu/efi-sonoma-t440p.git
    ```
    Rename the folder efi-sonoma-t440p to EFI
2. Generate SMBIOS with GenSMBIOS:

    In this step i use SMBIOS `MacBookPro16,1`, Open a terminal or Command Prompt
    ```bash
    cd GenSMBIOS
    ./GenSMBIOS.command
    ```
    Select ` 1 ` to update OpenCore and than ` 2 ` to select config.plist file on the EFI > OC directory and the final select ` 3 ` to generate SMBIOS and than ` Q ` to exit.

3. Edit config.plist if needed.

4. Create USB bootable.

    <b>Balena Etcher</b>

    Run Balena Etcher and select disk image of Hackintosh, than select USB drive and Flash.

    <b>Manual</b>

    Format USB Drive to EFI bootloader using disk or gParted (Linux) or Partition Wizard (Windows).

5. CopyPaste the EFI Folder to the EFI Partition

    Open the mounted EFI partition (e.g., /mnt/EFI on Linux or the assigned drive letter on Windows). Navigate to the EFI folder you renamed earlier. Paste the copied EFI folder into the root of the EFI partition.

## üèÅ Final Steps
After copying the EFI folder, ensure your configuration is set correctly in the config.plist. Boot from the USB drive and follow any additional setup instructions specific to your system.
